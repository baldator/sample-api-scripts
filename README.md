# Sample API scripts

This repo contains sample scripts in various languages. These scripts use the
Vega core and wallet APIs to interact with Vega core nodes and wallet servers.

## Credentials

In order to run sample scripts, credentials and other private details are
needed. There are *template* credentials files named `credentials-template.zz`
(where `zz` depends on the language). Rename these files be removing `-template`
and populate them with real data.

Non-template credentials files are listed in `.gitignore` so they don't get
accidentally committed.
